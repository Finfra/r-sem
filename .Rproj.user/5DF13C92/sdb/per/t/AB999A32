It's an honor and pleasure to introduce you my shiny app-`Structural Equation Modeling with R`.\n\n\n## What this app aims\n\nThis app is for reseachers, students or professors who want to perform structural equation modeling(sem). With this app, you can perform `structural equation modeling` with `just one-click`. You can perform the `confirmatory factor analysis`, fit a `structural equation model`, fit a `growth curve model`, and fit a `partial least square(PLS) model`. Additionally, you can obtain beautiful plots in png, svg or pdf format. You can download the results with html or PDF format. You can also download the powerpoint file with `just one click`.  \n\n## What you need for this app\n\nAll you need for this app is a modern web browser supporting HTML5(chrome, opera, safari and ...). `No R installation` is required. `No LaTex` installation is required. This app is independent of operating system of your computer. Windows, Mac and Linux PCs are all compatible. You can use even `a tablet PC` or `a smartphone`.\n\n\n## Which Sever is available\n\nAt present, I maintained six servers. You can choose any server among followings. Please find the nearest server and ejoy the app.\n\nApp    | Sinapore,SG|Frankfurt,DE|London,UK|Fremont,CA|Dallas,TX|Newark,NJ|\n-------|------------|------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|\nr-sem  |  [r-sem](http://45.118.135.113:3838/r-sem)| [r-sem](http://85.90.244.159:3838/r-sem)|[r-sem](http://88.80.188.114:3838/r-sem)|[r-sem](http://198.74.50.54:3838/r-sem)|[r-sem](http://23.239.25.35:3838/r-sem)|[r-sem](http://45.79.141.61:3838/r-sem)\n\n## Othe Apps created by web-r.org\n\nYou can find other useful apps created by me. One of these, you can perform meta-analysis by the mata app.\n\n\nApp    | Sinapore,SG|Frankfurt,DE|London,UK|Fremont,CA|Dallas,TX|Newark,NJ|\n-------|------------|------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|\nr-meta  | [r-meta](http://45.118.135.113:3838/meta)|[r-meta](http://85.90.244.159:3838/meta)|[r-meta](http://88.80.188.114:3838/meta)|[r-meta](http://198.74.50.54:3838/meta)|[r-meta](http://23.239.25.35:3838/meta)|[r-meat](http://45.79.141.61:3838/meta)\n\n\n## Coming soon\n \nOther apps including web-based `ggplot2` app and web-based `analysis using R` will be available soon. \n\n## Issues\n\n[https://github.com/cardiomoon/r-sem/issues](https://github.com/cardiomoon/r-sem/issues)\n\n## About the Author \n\nMy name is Keon-Woong Moon.
